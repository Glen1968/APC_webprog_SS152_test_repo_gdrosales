It took one look
Then forever laid out in front of me
One smile then I died
Only to be revived by you

There I was
Thought I had everything figured out
Goes to show just how much I know
'bout the way life plays out...

[Chorus:]
I take one step away
then I find myself coming back to you
My one and only, one and only you...ooh...

Now I know
That I know not a thing at all

Except the fact that I am yours
And that you are mine

Ooh,
They told me that this wouldn't be easy
And no
I'm not one to complain...

[Chorus:]
I take one step away
then I find myself coming back to you
My one and only, one and only
I take one step away
then I find myself coming back to you
My one and only, one and only
you...
