It was envisioned as a learning<br>	institution that produces graduates who fulfill information technology industry demands.

	Asia Pacific College emphasizes industry-academe links, orienting their programs<br>	and faculty toward industry needs. APC's cornerstones are its IT-embedded curriculum,<br>	industry-experienced faculty and its six-month internship program.<br>
